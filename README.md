## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone
   cd taskify
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
     JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
     REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your-refresh-token-secret
     ```

4. Start the development servers:
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm start
     ```
